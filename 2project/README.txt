Hello, 

You are in the folder 2project. Here are two .cpp files, one .h and CMakeLists. Also, here is a an empty folder "build" just to skip mkdir part.


First, you should move to the folder "build", then run cmake and make.
Second, run the executable file 2project and specify arguments
Finally, relax and enjoy the output:)

Here are the terminal commands:

cd ./build
cmake -S ../
make
./2project 4 5 6
